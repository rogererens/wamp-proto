## Protocol Overview

_This section is non-normative._

The PubSub messaging pattern defines three roles: _Subscribers_ and _Publishers_, which communicate via a _Broker_.

The routed RPC messaging pattern also defines three roles: _Callers_ and _Callees_, which communicate via a _Dealer_.

A _Router_ is a component which implements one or both of the Broker and Dealer roles. A _Client_ is a component which implements any or all of the Subscriber, Publisher, Caller, or Callee roles.

WAMP _Connections_ are established by Clients to a Router. Connections can use any _transport_ which is message-oriented, ordered, reliable and bi-directional, with WebSocket as the default transport.

WAMP _Sessions_ are established over a WAMP Connection. A WAMP Session is joined to a _Realm_ on a Router. Routing occurs only between WAMP Sessions that have joined the same Realm.

The _WAMP Basic Profile_ defines the parts of the protocol that are required to establish a WAMP connection, as well as for basic interactions between the four client and two router roles. WAMP implementations are required to implement the Basic Profile, at minimum.

The _WAMP Advanced Profile_ defines additions to the Basic Profile which greatly extend the utility of WAMP in real-world applications. WAMP implementations may support any subset of the Advanced Profile features. They are required to announce those supported features during session establishment.
